# Administrator Dashboard: Exam Management

This guide covers the complete examination scheduling workflow for one active
Administrator account. After V38, no coordinator assignment, Scheduling Lead
permission, or approval by another Administrator is required.

## Entry Points

All period operations require `ADMINISTRATOR` authority and use the existing bearer
token.

| UI area | Endpoint | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operations overview | `GET /api/dashboard/admin` | Today's operational summary. Not the period-management source of truth. |
| Period list | `GET /api/admin/examination-periods` | List period cycle, dates, status, revision, and publication timestamp. |
| Period detail | `GET /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}` | Load schedule settings, courses, exams, bookings, allocations, assignments and review details. |
| Course catalogue | `GET /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/courses?schoolId={schoolId}` | Load active courses and matching registered-student counts; `schoolId` is optional. |
| Venues | `GET /api/admin/examination-periods/venues` | Load venue details and verified `examination_capacity`. |
| Venue availability | `GET /api/admin/examination-periods/venue-unavailability` | Load blocked intervals. |
| Historical allocation audit | `GET /api/admin/examination-periods/allocation-audit` | Show legacy allocation rows needing review. |

The dashboard overview's `venueOccupancy` uses classroom capacity, not examination
seating capacity. Use period detail and venue `examination_capacity` for exam seating.

## Draft Workflow

1. Create a period with `POST /api/admin/examination-periods`. The body contains
   `name`, `academicYear`, `semester`, `examType`, `startDate`, `endDate`,
   `daysOfWeek`, and `slots`. Dates and times use institution-local scheduling time.
2. Configure venue examination capacities with
   `PUT /api/admin/examination-periods/venues/{venue}/capacity` and record blocked
   intervals with `POST /api/admin/examination-periods/venues/{venue}/unavailability`.
3. Select courses/durations with
   `PUT /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/courses` using the latest `revision`.
4. Generate a draft with
   `POST /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/generate` and
   `{ "revision": n, "searchLimit": 100000 }`.
5. Review generated dates, times, venues, allocations, unallocated students,
   conflicts and capacity. Generation does not publish.
6. If needed, edit a draft placement using
   `PUT /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/exams/{session}/placement` with
   `{ "revision": n, "examDate": "YYYY-MM-DD", "startTime": "HH:mm",
   "venueIds": [1] }`. The server recalculates allocations and validates the draft.
7. Assign invigilators manually with
   `POST /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/invigilators`, or generate them with
   `POST /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/auto-assign-invigilators`. Review
   shortages and assignments. The separate administrator assignment APIs may also
   be used for eligible legacy/unmanaged examinations.
8. Load `GET /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/validation`. Keep Publish disabled
   while `valid` is false and show every `problems` entry.
9. Publish explicitly with
   `POST /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/publish` and
   `{ "revision": n }`. The backend validates again and publishes the period,
   exams and staffing atomically.

To replace a generated draft, use the explicit
`POST /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/reset-draft` operation with the current
revision, then select courses or regenerate. Explain which draft data will be cleared
before the user confirms. Do not offer unpublish or ordinary post-publication edits.

## Change Requests

Use `GET /api/examination-change-requests?periodId={id}` to review all requests in a
period. Approve or reject with
`POST /api/examination-change-requests/{requestId}/decision` and
`{ "status": "APPROVED" | "REJECTED", "decision": "..." }`.
This only records a decision; it must not modify the timetable or imply that an
amendment has been applied.

Optional capacity-enquiry helpers are
`GET /api/examination-change-requests/capacity-lecturers?periodId={id}&courseCode={code}`
and `POST /api/examination-change-requests/capacity-draft`. The latter returns a
copyable draft only; it does not send email or change venue capacity.

## Published Amendments

The API base is `/api/admin/examination-periods/{period}/amendments`.

1. Propose an amendment with `POST` to the base path. Include `examSessionId`, the
   current `revision`, `examDate`, `startTime`, `reason`, and optionally `venueIds`
   and `duties` when changing the retained set.
2. Review the proposal and validation scope. The exam must be published, future,
   scheduled, and have no attendance, incident or generated-report records.
3. Explicitly approve or reject with `POST /{id}/decision` and
   `{ "status": "APPROVED" | "REJECTED", "reason": "..." }`. The same
   Administrator may approve their own proposal. Approval leaves the published
   timetable unchanged.
4. After approval, explicitly apply with `POST /{id}/apply`. Apply revalidates
   current slots, venue capacity, bookings, allocations, eligibility and staffing.
   On success, the period revision increments, before/after snapshots are stored,
   and notifications are queued.
5. Inspect delivery using `GET /{id}/notifications`. Retry failed inbox delivery
   with `POST /{id}/retry-notifications`. A retry does not apply the timetable change
   again and must not increment revision.

The API also exposes `GET /api/admin/examination-periods/{id}/history` for audit
history. Render amendment snapshots as before/after arrangements, not as a mutable
published timetable editor.

## Response and State Handling

- Period and JDBC-backed scheduling rows use snake_case field names. Requests use
  camelCase. Do not expect a `coordinator_staff_id` or coordinator capability flag
  in the period response.
- Use the returned latest `revision` after setup, selection, generation, placement,
  reset, publication, and applied amendments. Refresh detail after staffing or
  capacity changes before publishing.
- Generation outcomes include `COMPLETE`, `INVALID_INPUT`,
  `NO_FEASIBLE_ARRANGEMENT`, and `SEARCH_LIMIT_REACHED`. The last three can have
  `success: false` and useful response data; preserve and display it.
- Show `400` validation errors, `403` access errors, and `409` stale revision,
  validation, or locked-state conflicts distinctly. Never hide the server's blocker.
- Keep amendment approval and apply as separate actions. Retry notification is a
  third, delivery-only action.

## Acceptance Checks

- An ordinary active Administrator can create a period, configure courses, generate
  and edit a draft, staff it, resolve validation blockers, and publish without a
  period-owner assignment.
- Publication cannot proceed with validation problems; generation alone never
  publishes.
- The same Administrator can decide a Lecturer request and separately propose,
  approve, and apply a valid amendment.
- Applied amendments pass fresh validation, preserve eligibility restrictions,
  increment revision once, retain before/after records and notify affected users.
- Retrying notifications does not reapply the amendment or change revision.
